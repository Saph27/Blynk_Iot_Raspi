# LED Control Using Blynk and Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to control an LED remotely using the Blynk IoT platform and a Raspberry Pi.

## Components
- Raspberry Pi
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Internet connection
- Blynk app

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the LED to the Raspberry Pi. Follow standard LED circuit diagrams for proper wiring.

2. **Blynk Setup:**
   - Follow the instructions in [SETUP_blynk.md](../SETUP_blynk.md) to set up Blynk on your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Raspberry Pi Configuration:**
   - Download and install the Blynk library if not already done.
   - Create a Python script (e.g., `led_control.py`) to interact with Blynk and control the LED.

4. **Running the Code:**
   - Execute the Python script on your Raspberry Pi to start controlling the LED remotely.

## Code

For the code used in this project, see [led_control.py](led_control.py).
